# Advent of code 2020

It's that time of the year again in whcih I realise I know nothing of
programming and people on the internet show me some amazing concepts and ideas
about the programming languages I use.

This year, the languages I pick will be Rust and Go (again). I somewhat want to
get their concepts into my head and also figure out the packaging systems. So
instead of duplicating the codes (like I did last year), there will be a `go`
and a `rust` directory in which the puzzles will get solved.
